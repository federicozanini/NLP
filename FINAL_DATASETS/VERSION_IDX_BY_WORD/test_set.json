to the variation in mammalian coloration these selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals although there is also evidence that sexual selection communication and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators indicating health for reproductive purposes communicating between mother and young and intimidating predators studies have shown that in some cases differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels which are important in the mate selection process one final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments although much has been observed about color variation much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown the genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by 1 altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs and 2 altering the density and distribution of the hairs

the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options in part these

through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye thus the initial stage of ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging as a result of the above features the spread of ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area in contrast the human immunodeficiency virus hiv kills its victims very slowly by attacking
